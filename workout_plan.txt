As a professional fitness trainer, I've created a 7-day workout plan for a beginner aiming to gain weight, with a focus on high-protein, vegetarian, and dairy-free dietary preferences. This plan will help you build muscle mass and increase your overall weight in a healthy and sustainable way.

3. **Progressive Overload**: Gradually increase the weight, reps, or sets over time to challenge your muscles and promote growth.
4. **Rest and Recovery**: Allow 1-2 rest days per week to allow your muscles to recover and rebuild.
